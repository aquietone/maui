- Copy previous level INIs to current level if one is found (within 10 levels)
- Selecting a list item like DPS1 will drill-down to an edit view for the selected item, rather than 
  drawing the edit fields for the selected item in-line.
  InputText fields don't seem to be very responsive if several textures are being drawn, like if the DPS tab
  is showing 15 spells at once. The InputText fields can barely be typed in during that scenario.
